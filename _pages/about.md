Hey there!

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu), pursuing dual degrees in Biological Sciences with a double major in Psychology, and Mathematics and Computer Science. I am an undergraduate research assistant at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://bios.uic.edu) where I use Zebrafish as a model organism to study the various cell mechanisms important for development.

Currently, I am working as a bioinformatics analyst-cum-researcher at the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu) as part of their flagship [Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR)](https://www.mcw.edu/education/graduate-school/prospective-students/summer-program-for-undergraduate-research). 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, travelling, reading non-fiction books, exploring Indian restaurants, and (sometimes) coding. I grew up in [New Delhi, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), and moved to [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago) in August 2019.
